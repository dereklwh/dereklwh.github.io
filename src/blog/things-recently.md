# Some things that amused me today

The picture below randomly popped into my head today.

I was also reading documentation for Riot.js for work today and stumbled upon this which was kinda interesting:

#### Zen of Python by **Tim Peters**

> *Beautiful is better than ugly.*
> 
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> 
> Simple is better than complex.
> 
> Complex is better than complicated.
> 
> Flat is better than nested.
> 
> Sparse is better than dense.
> 
> Readability counts.
> 
> Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
> 
> Although practicality beats purity.
> 
> Errors should never pass silently.
> 
> Unless explicitly silenced.
> 
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> 
> There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
> 
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
> 
> Now is better than never.
> 
> Although never is often better than *right* now.
> 
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
> 
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> 
> Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those!

That's all.
