# On Failure

I find **failure** scary. But looking back, my failures have played a huge role in shaping me into who I am today. 

"Your failure's don't define you" is a quote that I do not think is true, as I believe that owning my failures is what pushed me to grow.


## Interviews
- Rejected from like over 20 different companies on co-op searches
- Felt underprepared or underqualified for some of them
    - Used what I learned to become better for the next
- Didn't hear back from even more companies

## Dream School
- Rejected from UBC Sauder in 2020
- Silver lining: amazing cs + bus program at SFU. Take full advantage of opportunities here: Exchange, Co-op, Beedie, CS Programs, clubs (MISA, Blueprint)

## More to come
- Advice to myself: **Seek discomfort** and expect to **fail more**. That is the best way to grow fast.

## Conclusion
Failure isn't the enemy, fear of failure is. Facing your fears and potentially failing is the only way I know to succeed and evolve.
