# List of Failures

## Interviews
- Rejected from like over 20 different companies
- Felt underprepared or underqualified for some of them
    - used what I learned to become better for the next
- Didn't hear back from even more companies

## Dream School
- Rejected from UBC Sauder in 2020
- Silver lining: amazing cs + bus program at SFU. Take full advantage of opportunities here: Exchange, Co-op, Beedie, CS Programs, clubs (MISA, Blueprint)

## More to come
- Advice to myself: **Seek discomfort** and expect to **fail more**. That is the best way to grow fast.
