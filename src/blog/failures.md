# On Failure

I find **failure** scary. But looking back, my failures have played a huge role in shaping me into who I am today. 

"Your failure's don't define you" is a quote that I do not think is true, as I believe that owning my failures is what pushed me to grow.

Upon reflecting on past failures, I realise that in hindsight, I am sort of (weirdly?) grateful to have had the chances to fail. Having those chances in the first place meant that I was able to put myself in situations where the stakes mattered to me. And while sometimes it didn't work out, I was able to take something away from each experience. Here are some failures that I have learned from throughout my time:

## Job Search
- Rejected from ~20+ different interviews (Samsung x2, Rivian, Sophos, ICBC, BCI, etc...)
- Felt underprepared or underqualified for some of them
    - Used what I learned to become better for the next
- Submitted 100+ job applications in 2025 to finally land a co-op

## Dream School
- Rejected from UBC Sauder in 2020
- **Silver lining:** Rejection is redirection. I was able to be a part of an amazing CS + Business program at SFU, taking full advantage of my opportunities here: Exchange, Co-op, Beedie, CS Programs, clubs (MISA, Blueprint).

## Future Failures
- More to come!! :)

## Conclusion
I have a couple of key takeaways upon reflecting on my failures.

1. **Celebrate your successes.** Your failures play a bigger part in your success than you might realise.
2. **Be Gritty.** Even if you are getting beaten down over and over and over and over again, you have to get back up and keep going. Eventually things will go your way.
3. **Failure isn't the enemy, fear of failure is.** Being able to face your fears in potentially failing is the only way to grow. I would much rather fail at something than regret not having done it 10 times out of 10. And who knows, maybe you might suprise yourself!
4. **DYB, DYB, DYB.** This was a chant that we would say as cub scouts and it stands for do your best (x3). As long as you give your all in every opportunity or situation you face, you can be proud of yourself regardless of the results.
5. **Seek discomfort** and expect to **fail more**. That is the best way to grow fast.
