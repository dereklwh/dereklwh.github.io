# Reading Challenge 2025

This year, I challenged myself with reading 15 books for the year. I can proudly say that as of last week, I have accomplished this goal with a couple of weeks remaining. I have explored a myriad of genres spanning from war philosophy to sports analytics to classics like 1984 and Harry Potter. While I wasn't on pace to meet my goal in the beginning of the year, my reading habits went up a notch throughout the past couple of months. Last year, My goal was a book a month and I was only 67% successful in completing it. This year, I was more ambitious and aimed for a higher goal, which effectively pushed me to read more than I ever had in my life. In this post, I will reflect on my 2025 reading challenge.

## Why should you read?

Before I started my reading journey, I spent a large amount of my free time playing video games and using my phone. While I don't regret all the memories that I made playing video games with my friends, I found that my phone habits were becoming a problem. I realised that instead of watching short-form videos that I would forget about within a couple of hours, I could have been spending that time on more meaningful activities like building personal relationships or reading a book. If you are trying to escape the addictive grips of your phone, I'd highly recommend reading books.

The reason why this habit has stuck as an alternative to using my phone is because of the personal value that I get from reading. I love the idea of the extraordinarily disproportional return on time that you benefit from reading; You are able to access the best ideas and thoughts of an author without having to spend the years or decades of life experiences to create these unique writings. That's why reading feels like a cheatcode to life.

## What did I learn?
An underrated skill that I got to sharpen through my reading journey was my focus. Being able to sit down and read a book over a fixed period of time helped build the transferable skill that I could bring over to the classroom and my work. The book Deep Work by Cal Newport helped me justify building this habit and create a more structured daily routine with highly focused work blocks.

Reading has also increased my appreciation for writing. I like to think of reading and writing as I/O in computing. While I am still trying to improve, I've been trying to right (write) my bad habits I picked up from using ChatGPT as a "writing fancifier" tool. While it is a powerful writing assistant, I want to find my own personal voice back even if that means having mediocre writing for a while. As I continue to expand my lexicon through reading, I hope my writing becomes more dynamic, personalized, and intentional.

## What would I do for the future
In the process of writing this, I realised that while I know the general idea of each book that I have read this year, some of the finer details have left my brain. I created some notes and anotations for each book in a separate notebook, but I want to create more structured essays and summaries for each book that I read to strengthen my experience of reading them. While the act of reading is beneficial, it is still a passive activity. Being able to train my brain by actively reflecting through writing/typing out my thoughts would significantly strengthen my critical thinking. Maybe I will have a deeper dive on my book specific learnings in the future. 

## Advices through my experiences
Reading multiple books at once is a gamechanger. While I was skeptical at first, I realised that it was no different to keeping up with multiple shows at once. In times where I don't feel like reading something too heavy or technical, I can just work on reading something lighthearted and fun like Harry Potter. Being able to jump into something that I want to read at any time has made reading different genres a lot more enjoyable overall.

Get a Kindle or Kobo to read more. After buying my Kindle I found reading to be a lot more accessible which consequently increased my reading rate by a lot. I finished >400 pages of reading throughout early December in the midst of an extremely heavy final exam schedule. I think this also has to do with arranging your physical environment to make it more likely for you to read. If I have a kindle on my desk next to my phone, I can make the "right decision" more easily by picking up my Kindle :D.

Book Recommendations: Out of all the books that I have read this year, my top 3 would be 1984, Why We Sleep, and Meditations. 1984 made me realise why classics are considered classics. The storytelling and psychological depth of this dystopian book showed me how awesome and culturally impactful books could be. For anyone who hasn't read it yet, I would say this is 100% a must read. While I understood the importance of sleep before reading Why We Sleep, it really solidified how paramount sleep is. Because of this book, I have prioritized good sleep for the whole year and will continue to for the rest of my life. Lastly, Meditations is another classic that I think everyone should read. It introduced me to stoicism and it has a lot of quotes that are so good. I found the George Long version to be hard to understand but I enjoyed the more modern writing style of the Gregory Hays translation.

## Conclusion
Reading is fun and everyone should read. It makes you more empathetic and consider different types of ideas. It is crazy how you can read the best work of an Author who might've spent years on the book in a fraction of that time. You are basically downloading years of lived experiences through reading their thoughts and ideas (fiction or non-fiction). In a time where social media and short form content are ruling our attention, picking up a book becomes a simple yet effective way to take back control.
