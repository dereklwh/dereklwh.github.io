# Reading Challenge 2025

This year, I challenged myself with reading 15 books for the year. I can proudly say that as of last week, I have accomplished this goal with a couple of weeks remaining. I have explored a myriad of genres spanning from war philosophy to sports analytics to classics like 1984 and Harry Potter. While I wasn't on pace to meet my goal in the beginning of the year, my reading habits went up a notch throughout the past couple of months. Last year, My goal was a book a month and I was only 67% successful in completing it. This year, I was more ambitious and aimed for a higher goal, which effectively pushed me to read more than I ever had in my life.

## Why read?

Before I started my reading journey, I spent a large amount of my free time playing video games and using my phone. While I don't regret all the memories that I made playing video games with friends, I found that my phone habits were becoming a problem. I realised that instead of watching videos that I would forget within a couple of hours, I could have been spending that time on more meaningful activities like building personal relationships or reading a book. If you are trying to escape the grips of your phone, I'd highly recommend reading books.

The reason why this habit has stuck as an alternative to using my phone is because of the value that I get from reading. I love the idea of the extraordinarily disproportional benefit that you receive from reading an authors best works which might take them years or their lifetime to distill. Seems like a cheatcode to life.

## What did I learn?
I learned that it has improved my focus. Being able to sit down and read a book over a fixed period of time is a skill that I had to relearn.

While I am still trying to improve, I am trying to right (write) my bad habits that I have learned from the ease of writing "good" material that came with AI tools like ChatGPT. While they are good a good tool, I want to find my own personal voice back even if that means having mediocre writing for a while. I am slowly fattening my lexicon from my reading journey and with that my writing will hopefully become more dynamic and personal.

### Favourite Quotes
```

"Straight, not straightened"

"poopy boobies"

## How did I do it

## Advices and more through trial and error
- Reading multiple books at once. Anology of watching multiple shows at once. Sometimes I might not want to read a certain genre at the moment and gravitate to a specific book.

## Tools
KINDlE! or Kobo to read more. After buying my Kindle I found reading to be a lot more accessible which consequently increased my reading rate by a lot. I finished >400 pages of reading throughout early December in the middle of an extremely heavy final exam schedule.
