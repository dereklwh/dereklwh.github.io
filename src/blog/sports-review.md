# My 2025 as a Sports Fan

![Hughes](/src/assets/blog/hughes.png)

I enjoy good competition, both participating in it and witnessing it; There is something so captivating watching two sides give it their all to compete for the same goal. Something is bound to happen for both sides whether it is the pure elation of winning it all or devastating heartbreak of just coming short. And the tension that builds up throughout the competition is just so addicting as a spectator.

My 2025 has been filled with ups and downs both as a spectator, diehard fan, and a bandwagon fan. Storylines and moments such as the NHL 4 nations cup, MLB World Series, SGA's emergence, and league breaking trades have made 2025 year to remember for sports (or forget... if you're a Canucks fan). I will be reflecting on the sports moments that have defined my year as a sports fan in 2025.

### 4 Nations Cup

What a tournament this was. Hockey fans have been deprived of best-on-best competition for almost a decade and this tournament featuring just 4 countries proved how entertaining international hockey can be. It was an amazing taster for the 2026 olympics in Milan, and I believe that nothing can beat the intensity and drama that is produced in these heavy tilts between the best hockey players in the world.

The Sweden and Canada game featured a dazzling goal between the three best Canadian players of 97, 87, and 29 [within the first minute of the tournament](https://youtu.be/ZHGCfC08mHg?si=xW93qUiYuLp-0l_f&t=22). This was the quickest return on investment imageinable for Canadian hockey fans who have waited years for these players to play together.

And of course the finals of the tournament was between USA and Canada, a rematch of the 2010 olympics where Sidney Crosby scored the [golden goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7DeQbTzPE8) in GM place at the time. This time, we got another golden goal moment with Connor McDavid scoring an overtime winner after some heroic saves from Jordan Binnington to keep the Canadian's alive. Watching and celebrating this with my coworkers at the Roger's Arena Sportsbar was a highlight of my internship with the Canucks.

### March Madness
We did a bracket at work and while I didn't win, I discovered one of my favourite names in basketball: Derik Queen, aka Dairy Queen or Baby Jokic. I chose Maryland to win it all because of my Dairy Queen fandom but they ultimately fell short in the semi finals.

### League of Legends MSI 2025 in Vancouver

Yes, esports count as sport. Watching an international League of Legends tournament has always been on my bucket list and I had the opportunity to attend the mid-season invitational hosted in Vancouver. This tournament is the second most prestigeous tournament in the e-sport behind Worlds, where the best teams around the world compete for the MSI cup. I had the opportunity to attend multiple series between Korea's 2 best teams GenG and T1 and between Korea's best versus China's best team.

### Canada's Team

The entire MLB playoffs run for the Blue Jay's was a ride to remember and it was very reminiscent to the Toronto Raptors run of 2019 with Kawhi Leonard. Watching the series between them and the Yankees, Mariners, and eventually the Dodgers was the highlight of my fall 2025.

While I didn't watch any of the regular season games, I was aware of their regular season success, listening to Blue Jays radio every morning on my way up to school for my summer classes. Quickly, I realised that there was something brewing and I could not imagine it culminating into a game 7 where extra innings were needed to decide the World Series. This game was probably one of the most intense sports games I have watched in my life. There is something so unique about the interaction between the pitcher and the batter in such high stakes situations. I felt this undescribable intensity through every pitch of the game.

There were so many dramatic moments like the fly out by substitute player Pages to save the game, the IKF run to home plate which was a couple inches away from winning the game, and the lockdown performance by Yamamoto that was the cherry on top of his MVP performance in the 2025 playoffs. This playoff series really rejuvinated my interest in playoff baseball and I was able to appreciate the many little details of baseball that I never noticed before.


### MLS Finals
Admittedly, I am not the biggest soccer fan but I will tune in to FIFA world cup and anything that Canada's national team is involved in. The Vancouver Whitecaps were on a tear this season and were able to land one of the biggest signing of the MLS behind only the GOAT of sports arguable in Leonel Messi.

While I had no idea how the playoff format worked, I do know that the LAFC game will go down as one of the best games in club history. It was very fitting for the finals to be between Muller's Whitecaps and Messi's Inter Miami. Attending the watch party at BC place hours before my data communication and networking final exam, I was able to experience the electricity of the crowd when Ali Ahmed tied it up in the second half of the game. While the Whitecaps ultimately fell short, the game was one that the team could be proud of and build upon for the culture of the club.

### NBA

SGA cementing himself as one of the greatest canadian basketball players ever. While the series was a lot closer than expected, the OKC Thunder ultimately got the job done, marking the start of a potential dynasty after a very swift rebuild with tonnes of first round draft picks. I was able to watch game 7 with my diehard SGA fan coworker at a basketball sports bar which was a fun experience. Sports is ultimately about community and spending time with friends to cheer on the same (or opposite) team.


### The Trade That Shocked the Sports World (and the Quinn Hughes trade)

The Luka Doncic trade is going to go down as the worst trade in NBA history. Trading the face of the league for absolutely no reason is neither a good way to run a team or gain the approval of your fans. Especially after just coming off of an NBA finals run, this trade hit everyone that paid any attention to the NBA like a truck.

The Maverick's didn't even make the playoffs after this trade, losing out in the play in rounds. However, through a divine intervention, Nico Harrison's Mavericks were gifted a lottery win for the first overall pick with a 1.8% chance of winning (hmmm, something smells fishy...). 

Fast forward to December 12th, 4:30PM, and the corner stone player of my childhood team Vancouver Canucks, Quinn Hughes gets shipped out to Minnesota after a wildly dissapointing start to the regular season. While the writing was on the wall for a couple of months, it didn't take the shock away for the next week to come.

## Looking Forward
- 2026 Olympics in Milan
- FIFA World Cup 2026
- NHL 2026 Draft Lottery (Gavin Mckenna to Canucks please)


## Conclusions
Being a sports fan means accepting uncertainty. It means investing emotionally with no guarantees, knowing that heartbreak is just as likely as triumph, but choosing to care anyway. As a Canucks fan, that kind of optimism might be borderline delusional for me, but it’s also what keeps the experience meaningful. The belief that next year **could be different** is part of the ritual.

Looking back at 2025, it was filled with epic and heartbreaking moments. But at the end of the day, it is just a medium of entertainment for me and I don't need to take the results too seriously. The most important aspect of sports is really the sense of community and building moments and memories with the people around me. That is what makes being a sports fan really worth it.
